# --- EXCEPTIONS (Whitelist useful stuff) ---
# Allow specific small config files or important scripts even if they are in ignored folders (if needed)

# But we actually want to KEEP the folder structure, just ignore contents
# Git doesn't track empty folders, so usually we add .gitkeep. 

# For this user request: "Useful Files Only"
# - final_phase1 (Code)
# - final_phase2 (Code)
# - final_student (Code)
# - scripts/
# - docs/ or logs/
